# Gestura
This repository contains a real-time sign language gesture recognition system built with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and classify gestures corresponding to digits (0-9), uppercase letters (A-Z), and spaces. The system captures video from a webcam and overlays the predicted gesture on the video feed.
